/*
Description:
Pad
You are exporting data from your environment that will be imported in another system, but you have a problem! Some data on your system doesn't contain the full length of required chars, it trimmed some data.

Registry Number   | Activity Code
1337              | 1337
60316817000448    | 6204000
You have to write two functions, padLeft and padRight that will fill the missing characters so the other system can import the data without any errors.

60316817000448    | 6204000
If you try to pad to a certain length that would make your data shorter just leave it as is.

It is much easier to import and validate the data in the correct format, so help them to get the data in the other server!
