/*
Description:
Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.

At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.

Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.

For example:

grabscrab( "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"] )
Should return ["sport", "ports"].

Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.

Good luck!

function grabscrab(anagram, dictionary) {
  anagram=anagram.split('').sort().join()
  let arr = dictionary.slice().map(v=>v.split('').sort().join()===anagram)
  return dictionary.filter((v,i)=>arr[i]===true)
}
