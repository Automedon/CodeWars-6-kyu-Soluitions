/*
Description:
You certainly can tell which is the larger number between 210 and 215.

But what about, say, 210 and 310? You know this one too.

Things tend to get a bit more complicated with both different bases and exponents: which is larger between 39 and 56?

Well, by now you have surely guessed that you have to build a function to compare powers, returning -1 if the first member is larger, 0 if they are equal, 1 otherwise; powers to compare will be provided in the [base, exponent] format:

comparePowers([2,10],[2,15])===1
comparePowers([2,10],[3,10])===1
comparePowers([2,10],[2,10])===0
comparePowers([3,9],[5,6])===-1
comparePowers([7,7],[5,8])===-1
Only positive integers will be tested, incluing bigger numbers - you are warned now, so be diligent try to implement an efficient solution not to drain too much on CW resources ;)!

function comparePowers([a,b],[x,y]){
  let f =Math.log10(a)*b;
  let s =Math.log10(x)*y;
  return f===s?0:f>s?-1:1
}
