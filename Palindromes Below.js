/*
Description:
The aim of this Kata is to modify the Fixnum ( JS: Number CS: extension for int) class to give it the palindrome_below ( JS: palindromeBelow CS: PalindromeBelow ) method. This method returns all numbers from and including 1 up to but not including itself that are palindromes for a given base.

For example in base 2 (binary)

1 = "1"
2 = "10"
3 = "11"
4 = "100"
Therefore 1 and 3 are palindromes in base two and the method should return the following.

    5..palindromeBelow(2)
    => [1, 3]
*/
Number.prototype.palindromeBelow = function(base){
  return Array.from({length:this},(x,i)=>i+1).map(v=>v.toString(base)).filter(v=>v===v.split``.reverse().join``).map(v=>parseInt(v,base))
}
