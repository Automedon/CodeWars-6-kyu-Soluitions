/*
Description:
The goal of this Kata is to return the greatest distance of index positions between matching number values in an array or 0 if there are no matching values.

Example: In an array with the values [0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1] the greatest index distance is between the matching '1' values at index 2 and 5. Executing greatestDistance against this array would return 3. (i.e. 5 - 2)

Here's the previous example in test form:

Test.assertEquals(greatestDistance([0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1]), 3);
This is based on a Kata I had completed only to realize I has misread the instructions. I enjoyed solving the problem I thought it was asking me to complete so I thought I'd add a new Kata for others to enjoy. There are no tricks in this one, good luck!

var greatestDistance = function(data) {
  let arr = []
  for (let i=0;i<data.length;i++){
    arr.push(data.lastIndexOf(data[i])-data.indexOf(data[i]))
  }
  return Math.max(...arr)
};
