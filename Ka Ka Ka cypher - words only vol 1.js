Introduction
Ka ka ka cypher is a cypher used by small children in some country. When a girl wants to pass something to the other girls and there are some boys nearby, she can use Ka cypher. So only the other girls are able to understand her.
She speaks using KA, ie.:
ka thi ka s ka bo ka y ka i ka s ka u ka gly what simply means this boy is ugly.

Task
Write a function KaCokadekaMe (ka_co_ka_de_ka_me in Python) that accepts a string word and returns encoded message using ka cypher.

Our rules:

The encoded word should start from ka.
The ka goes after vowel (a,e,i,o,u)
When there is multiple vowels together, the ka goes only after the last vowel
When the word is finished by a vowel, do not add the ka after
Input/Output
The word string consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters. There is only 1 word to convert - no white spaces.

Example
KaCokadekaMe("a");  //=> "kaa"
KaCokadekaMe("ka");  //=> "kaka"
KaCokadekaMe("aa"); //=> "kaaa"  
KaCokadekaMe("Abbaa"); //=> kaAkabbaa
KaCokadekaMe("maintenance"); //=> kamaikantekanakance
KaCokadekaMe("Woodie"); //=> kaWookadie
KacokadekaMe("Incomprehensibilities"); //=> kaIkancokamprekahekansikabikalikatiekas
Remark
Ka cypher's country residents, please don't hate me for simplifying the way how we divide the words into "syllables" in the Kata. I don't want to make it too hard for other nations ;-P
