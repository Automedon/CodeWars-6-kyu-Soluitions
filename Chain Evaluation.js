/*
Description:
Method chaining is a very interesting way to keep your program clean.

As a part of this Kata, you need to create functions such that one could evaluate the following expression:

(3).add(5).multiply(2)
The above expression evaluates to be 16.

You need to implement the following methods:

add
subtract
multiply
divide
square
After you're done, one could chain these five methods to create chains of almost any length.

Number.prototype.add=function(x){ return this+x};
Number.prototype.subtract=function(x){ return this-x;}
Number.prototype.multiply=function(x){ return this*x;}
Number.prototype.divide=function(x){ return this/x;}
Number.prototype.square=function(){ return this*this;}
