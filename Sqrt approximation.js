/*
We want to approximate the sqrt function. Usually this function takes a floating point number and returns another floating point number, but in this kata we're going to work with integral numbers instead.

Your task is to write a function that takes an integer n and returns either

an integer k if n is a square number, such that k * k == n or
a range (k, k+1), such that k * k < n and n < (k+1) * (k+1).
Examples
Test.assertDeepEquals( sqrtApproximation(4), 2 );
Test.assertDeepEquals( sqrtApproximation(5), [2,3] );
Note : pow() and sqrt() functions are disabled.

Remarks
In dynamic languages, return either a single value or an array/list. In Haskell, use Either.

function sqrtApproximation(number){
  for (let i=0;i<=number;i++){
  if (i*i===number) return i
  if (i*i>number) return [i-1,i];
  }
  return 0
}
