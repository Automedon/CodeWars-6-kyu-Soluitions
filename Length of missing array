/*
Description:
You get an array of arrays.
If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.
But one array is missing!


You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.

Example:
[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3


If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.

When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!
There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays. 

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.

function getLengthOfMissingArray(arrayOfArrays) {
  const lengths = (arrayOfArrays || [])
    .map(a => a ? a.length : 0)
    .sort((a, b) => a - b)
  
  if (lengths.includes(0)) {
    return 0
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < lengths.length - 1; i++) {
    if (lengths[i] + 1 !== lengths[i + 1]) {
      return lengths[i] + 1
    }
  }

  return 0
}
