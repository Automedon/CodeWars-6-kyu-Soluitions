Description:
You are given an integer N. Your job is to figure out how many substrings inside of N divide evenly with N.

Confused? I'll break it down for you.

Let's say that you are given the integer '877692'.

8 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/8 = 109711 with 4 remainder.

7 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/7 = 125384 with 4 remainder.

7 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/7 = 125384 with 4 remainder.

6 evenly divides with 877692. 877692/6 = 146282 with 0 remainder.

9 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/9 = 97521 with 3 remainder.

2 evenly divides with 877692. 877692/2 = 438846 with 0 remainder.
We aren't going to stop there though. We need to check ALL of the substrings inside of 877692.

87 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/87 = 10088 with 36 remainder.

77 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/77 = 11398 with 46 remainder.

76 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/76 = 11548 with 44 remainder.

69 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/69 = 12720 with 12 remainder.


etc.
#Rules:
-If an integer is 0, then it does NOT divide evenly into anything.
-Even though N can divide evenly with itself, we do not count it towards the end number. For Example:

N = 23, the answer will be 0.  
-If there are multiple instances of a number, they all get counted. For example:

N = 11, the answer will be 2 
#Input: A non negative integer.

#Output: The number of times you found an integer that was evenly divisible with N.

function getCount(n)
{
  const arr = [];
  let str =n.toString()
  for (let i=0;i<str.length;i++){
    for (let j=i;j<=str.length;j++){
      arr.push(str.slice(i,j))
    }
  }
  let count = 0
  arr.map(v=>n%v*1===0?count++:1)
  return count-1
}
