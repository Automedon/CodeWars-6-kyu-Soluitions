/*
Description:
Take the following IPv4 address: 128.32.10.1 This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).

1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000
2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000
3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010
4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001
So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001

Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the 32 bit number: 2149583361.

Write a function ip_to_int32(ip) ( JS: ipToInt32(ip) ) that takes an IPv4 address and returns a 32 bit number.

  ipToInt32("128.32.10.1") => 2149583361
*/

function ipToInt32(ip){
   return ip.split(".").reduce(function(int,v){ return int*256 + +v } )
}
