/*
Description:
Implement the method filter, which accepts a linked list (head) and a predicate function, and returns a new linked list (head) which only contains the elements which apply to the given predicate.

For example: Given the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3, and the predicate x => x >= 2, filter should return 2 -> 3, since x >= 2 applies to both 2 and 3.

The linked list is defined as follows:

function Node(data, next = null) {
  this.data = data;
  this.next = next;
}
Note: the list may be null and can hold any type of value.

Good luck!

function Node(data, next = null) {
  this.data = data;
  this.next = next;
}
function filter(head, p) {
  if (head) {
    return p(head.data) ? new Node(head.data, filter(head.next, p)) : filter(head.next, p);
  }
  return null;
}
