/*
Description:
As the title suggests, this is the hard-core version of another neat kata.

The task is simple to explain: simply sum all the numbers from the first parameter being the beginning to the second parameter being the upper limit (possibly included), going in steps expressed by the third parameter:

sequenceSum(2,2,2) === 2
sequenceSum(2,6,2) === 12 // 2 + 4 + 6
sequenceSum(1,5,1) === 15 // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
sequenceSum(1,5,3) === 5 // 1 + 4
If it is an impossible sequence (with the beginning being larger the end and a positive step or the other way around), just return 0. See the provided test cases for further examples :)

Note: differing from the other base kata, much larger ranges are going to be tested, so you should hope to get your algo optimized and to avoid brute-forcing your way through the solution.

function sequenceSum(begin, end, step){
  n = ~~((end - begin) / step + 1)
  return n <= 0 ? 0 : (2 * begin + step * (n - 1)) * n / 2
}
