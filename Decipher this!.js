/*
Description:
You are given a secret message you need to decipher. Here are the things you need to know to decipher it:

For each word:

the second and the last letter is switched (e.g. Hello becomes Holle)
the first letter is replaced by its character code (e.g. H becomes 72)
Note: there are no special characters used, only letters and spaces

Examples

decipherThis('72olle 103doo 100ya'); // 'Hello good day'
decipherThis('82yade 115te 103o'); // 'Ready set go'
*/
function decipherThis(str) {
  return str.replace(/\d+/g,v=>String.fromCharCode(v*1)).split(' ')
  .map(v=>v.length>2?v.slice(0,1)+v.slice(-1)+v.slice(2,-1)+v.slice(1,2):v).join` `
};
