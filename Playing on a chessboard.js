Description:
With a friend we used to play the following game on a chessboard (8, rows, 8 columns). On the first row at the bottom we put numbers:

1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8, 8/9

On row 2 (2nd row from the bottom) we have:

1/3, 2/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, 6/8, 7/9, 8/10

On row 3:

1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/7, 5/8, 6/9, 7/10, 8/11

until last row:

1/9, 2/10, 3/11, 4/12, 5/13, 6/14, 7/15, 8/16

When all numbers are on the chessboard each in turn we toss a coin. The one who get "head" wins and the other gives him, in dollars, the sum of the numbers on the chessboard. We play for fun, the dollars come from a monopoly game!

How much can I (or my friend) win or loses for each game if the chessboard has n rows and n columns? Add all of the fractional values on an n by n sized board and give the answer as a simplified fraction.

Ruby, Python, JS, Coffee, Clojure, PHP, Elixir, Crystal, Typescript, Go:

The function called 'game' with parameter n (integer >= 0) returns as result an irreducible fraction written as an array of integers: [numerator, denominator]. If the denominator is 1 return [numerator].

Haskell:
'game' returns either a "Left Integer" if denominator is 1 otherwise "Right (Integer, Integer)"

Java, C#, C++, F#, Swift, Reason:
'game' returns a string that mimicks the array returned in Ruby, Python, JS, etc...

Fortran, Bash: 'game' returns a string

In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.

function game(n) {
   return n % 2 == 0 ? [(n/2) * n] : [n**2, 2];
