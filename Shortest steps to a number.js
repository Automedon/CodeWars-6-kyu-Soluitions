Description:
Summary:
Given a number, num, return the shortest amount of steps it would take from 1, to land exactly on that number.

Description:
A step is defined as:

Adding 1 to the number: num += 1
Doubling the number: num *= 2
You will always start from the number 1 and you will have to return the shortest count of steps it would take to land exactly on that number.

1 <= num <= 10000

Examples:

num == 3 would return 2 steps:

1 -- +1 --> 2:        1 step
2 -- +1 --> 3:        2 steps

2 steps
num == 12 would return 4 steps:

1 -- +1 --> 2:        1 step
2 -- +1 --> 3:        2 steps
3 -- x2 --> 6:        3 steps
6 -- x2 --> 12:       4 steps

4 steps
num == 16 would return 4 steps:

1 -- +1 --> 2:        1 step
2 -- x2 --> 4:        2 steps
4 -- x2 --> 8:        3 steps
8 -- x2 --> 16:       4 steps

4 steps

function shortestStepsToNum(num) {
  if(num <= 1) return 0;
  if(num%2 == 1) return 1 + shortestStepsToNum(num -1);
  return 1 + shortestStepsToNum(num/2);
}
