Description:
Task :
Given a List [] of n integers , find minimum mumber to be inserted in a list, so that sum of all elements of list should equal the closest prime number .

Notes
List size is at least 2 .

List's numbers will only positives (n > 0) .

Repeatition of numbers in the list could occur .

The newer list's sum should equal the closest prime number .

Input >> Output Examples
1- minimumNumber ({3,1,2}) ==> return (1)
Explanation:
Since , the sum of the list's elements equal to (6) , the minimum number to be inserted to transform the sum to prime number is (1) , which will make *the sum of the List** equal the closest prime number (7)* .
2-  minimumNumber ({2,12,8,4,6}) ==> return (5)
Explanation:
Since , the sum of the list's elements equal to (32) , the minimum number to be inserted to transform the sum to prime number is (5) , which will make *the sum of the List** equal the closest prime number (37)* .
3- minimumNumber ({50,39,49,6,17,28}) ==> return (2)
Explanation:
Since , the sum of the list's elements equal to (189) , the minimum number to be inserted to transform the sum to prime number is (2) , which will make *the sum of the List** equal the closest prime number (191)* .
