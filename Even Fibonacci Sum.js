/*
Description:
Give the summation of all even numbers in a Fibonacci sequence up to, but not including, the maximum value.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next value is the addition of the previous two values. The series starts with 0 and 1:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...

For example:

fibonacci(0)==0
fibonacci(33)==10
fibonacci(25997544)==19544084
*/
function fibonacci(max) {
    let fib = [0,1]
    for (let i=1;fib[i-1]+fib[i]<max;i++){
      fib.push(fib[i-1]+fib[i])
    }
    return fib.reduce((a,b)=>a+(b%2==0?b:0),0)
}
