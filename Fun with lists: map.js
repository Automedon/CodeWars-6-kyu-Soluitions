/*
Description:
Implement the method map, which accepts a linked list (head) and a mapping function, and returns a new linked list (head) where every element is the result of applying the given mapping method to each element of the original list.

For example: Given the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3, and the mapping function x => x * 2, map should return 2 -> 4 -> 6

The linked list is defined as follows:

function Node(data, next = null) {
  this.data = data;
  this.next = next;
}
Note: the list may be null and can hold any type of value.

Good luck!

This kata is part of fun with lists series:

Fun with lists: length
Fun with lists: indexOf
Fun with lists: lastIndexOf
Fun with lists: countIf
Fun with lists: anyMatch + allMatch
Fun with lists: filter
Fun with lists: map
Fun with lists: reduce

function map(head, func) {
  if (head) {
    return new Node(func(head.data), map(head.next, func));
  }
  return null;
}
