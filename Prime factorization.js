Description:
The prime factorization of a positive integer is a list of the integer's prime factors, together with their multiplicities; the process of determining these factors is called integer factorization. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every positive integer has a single unique prime factorization.

The prime factorization of 24, for instance, is (2^3) * (3^1).

Write a class called PrimeFactorizer whose constructor accepts exactly 1 number (a positive integer) and has a property factor containing an object where the keys are prime numbers as strings and the values are the multiplicities.

new PrimeFactorizer(24).factor //should return { '2': 3, '3': 1 }
*/
function PrimeFactorizer(n) {
  let i, factors = {};
  for (i=2; i <= n; i++) {
    while (n%i === 0) {
      factors[i] = 1 + (factors[i]||0); n /= i;
    }
  }
  return {factor:factors};
}
