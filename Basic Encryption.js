/*
Description:
The most basic encryption method is to map a char to another char by a certain math rule. Because every char has an ASCII value, we can manipulate this value with a simple math expression. For example 'a' + 1 would give us 'b', because 'a' value is 97 and 'b' value is 98.

You will need to write a method which does exactly that -

get a string as text and an int as the rule of manipulation, and should return encrypted text. for example:

encrypt("a",1) = "b"

Full ascii table is used on our question (256 chars) - so 0-255 are the valid values.

Good luck.

function encrypt(text, rule) {
  return text.split('').map(v=>String.fromCharCode((v.charCodeAt()+rule)%256)).join(``)
};
