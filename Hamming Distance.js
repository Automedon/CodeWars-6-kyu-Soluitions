/*
Description:
The Hamming Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match.

Examples (in JavaScript):

hamming("I like turtles","I like turkeys")  //returns 3
hamming("Hello World","Hello World")  //returns 0
You can assume that the two input strings are of equal length.

function hamming(a,b) {
	let n = 0;
  for (let i=0;i<a.length;i++){
    if (a[i]!==b[i]){
    n++
    }
  }
  return n
}
