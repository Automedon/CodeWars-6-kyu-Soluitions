/*
Description:
An array is defined to be odd-heavy if it contains at least one odd element and every element whose value is odd is greater than every even-valued element.

eg.

Array [11,4,9,2,8] is odd-heavy 
because:- its odd elements [11,9] are greater than all the even elements [4,2,8]

Array [11,4,9,2,3,10] is not odd-heavy
because:- one of it's even element 10 from [4,2,10] is greater than two of its odd elements [9,3] from [ 11,9,3]
write a function called isOddHeavy or is_odd_heavy that accepts an integer array and returns true if the array is odd-heavy else return false.
*/
function isOddHeavy(n){
  let odd = n.filter(v=>v%2!==0).sort((a,b)=>a-b)
  let even = n.filter(v=>v%2==0)
  if (!odd.length) return false
  return even.every(v=>v<odd[0])
}
