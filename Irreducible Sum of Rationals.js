/*
Description:
You will have a list of rationals in the form

lst = [ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... , [numer_n, denom_n] ]
or

lst = [ (numer_1, denom_1) , ... , (numer_n, denom_n) ]
where all numbers are positive integers. You have to produce their sum N / D in an irreducible form: this means that N and D have only 1 as a common divisor.

Return the result in the form:

[N, D] in Ruby, Crystal, Python, Clojure, JS, CS, PHP, Julia
Just "N D" in Haskell, PureScript
"[N, D]" in Java, CSharp, TS, Scala, PowerShell
"N/D" in Go, Nim
{N, D} in C++, Elixir
"{N, D}" in C
Some((N, D)) in Rust
Some "N D" in F#, Ocaml
c(N, D) in R
(N, D) in Swift
If the result is an integer (D evenly divides N) return:

an integer in Ruby, Crystal, Elixir, Clojure, Python, JS, CS, PHP, R, Julia
Just "n" (Haskell, PureScript)
"n" Java, CSharp, TS, Scala, PowerShell, Go, Nim
{n, 1} in C++
"{n, 1}" in C
Some((n, 1)) in Rust
Some "n" in F#, Ocaml,
(n, 1) in Swift
If the input list is empty, return nil/None/null/Nothing (or {0, 1} in C++; "{0, 1}" in C) (or "0" in Scala, PowerShell, Go, Nim)

Example:
[ [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4] ]  -->  [13, 12]

    1/2  +  1/3  +  1/4     =      13/12
See sample tests for more examples and the form of results.
