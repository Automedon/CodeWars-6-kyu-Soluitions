Description:
Our nuclear missible manager system is coded in Node.js. We are currently testing the system and it seams that the launchAll function does not work as expected. It should launch 5 missiles each 1 second apart. The current code tries to launch the missile #5 five times...

Can you fix this for us? You know, it's pretty critical code...

Note: There are 5 missiles labeled i which is a number in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The missile i should be launched after i seconds.
*/
function launchAll(launchMissile) {
  for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      launchMissile(i);
    }, i * 1000);
  }
}
