/*
Description:
Write function divisibleCount(x, y, k) that takes in 3 numbers x, y and k, and returns the number of integers within the range [x..y] that are divisible by k i.e.:
{ i : x ≤ i ≤ y, i mod k = 0 }
For example:
x = 6, y = 11 and k = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.
Note: x<=y
*/
function divisibleCount(x, y, k) {
  return Math.floor(y/k) - Math.floor((x-1)/k)
}
