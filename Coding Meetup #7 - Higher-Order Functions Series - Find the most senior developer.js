/*
Description:
You will be given an array of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

Your task is to return an array which includes the developer who is the oldest. In case of a tie, include all same-age senior developers listed in the same order as they appeared in the original input array.

For example, given the following input array:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Gabriel', lastName: 'X.', country: 'Monaco', continent: 'Europe', age: 49, language: 'PHP' },
  { firstName: 'Odval', lastName: 'F.', country: 'Mongolia', continent: 'Asia', age: 38, language: 'Python' },
  { firstName: 'Emilija', lastName: 'S.', country: 'Lithuania', continent: 'Europe', age: 19, language: 'Python' },
  { firstName: 'Sou', lastName: 'B.', country: 'Japan', continent: 'Asia', age: 49, language: 'PHP' },
];
your function should return the following array:

[
  { firstName: 'Gabriel', lastName: 'X.', country: 'Monaco', continent: 'Europe', age: 49, language: 'PHP' },
  { firstName: 'Sou', lastName: 'B.', country: 'Japan', continent: 'Asia', age: 49, language: 'PHP' },
]
Notes:

The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.




This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.

function findSenior(list) {
  let max = Math.max(...list.map(v=>v.age))
  return list.filter(v=>v.age===max)
}
