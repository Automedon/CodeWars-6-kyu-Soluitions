/*
Help the frog to find a way to freedom
You have an array of integers and have a frog at the first position

[Frog, int, int, int, ..., int]

The integer itself may tell you the length and the direction of the jump

 For instance:
  2 = jump two indices to the right
 -3 = jump three indices to the left
  0 = stay at the same position
Your objective is to find how many jumps are needed to jump out of the array.

Return -1 if Frog can't jump out of the array

Example:
array = [1, 2, 1, 5]; 
jumps = 3  (1 -> 2 -> 5 -> <jump out>)
All tests for this Kata are randomly generated

function solution(a) {
  if (a.length===0) return -1
  let count=0;
  for (let i=0;i<a.length;i+=a[i]){
  if (i<0){break}
  count++
  if (count>1000){return -1}
  }
  return count
}
