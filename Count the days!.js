function countDays(d){
  let time = d
  let today=new Date()
  let todayCheck= time.getFullYear()===today.getFullYear()&&time.getMonth()===today.getMonth()&&time.getDay()===today.getDay()
  if (todayCheck) return "Today is the day!"
  let past = today.getTime()>time.getTime()
  if (past) return 'The day is in the past!'
  return `${Math.round((time.getTime()-today.getTime())/1000/60/60/24)} days`
}
