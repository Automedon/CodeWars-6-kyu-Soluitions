/*
Description:
Linked Lists - Length & Count

Implement Length() to count the number of nodes in a linked list.

length(null) => 0
length(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null) => 3
Implement Count() to count the occurrences of an integer in a linked list.

count(null, 1) => 0
count(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 1) => 1
count(1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> null, 2) => 4
I've decided to bundle these two functions within the same Kata since they are both very similar.

The push()/Push() and buildOneTwoThree()/BuildOneTwoThree() functions do not need to be redefined.

function Node(data) {
  this.data = data;
  this.next = null;
}

function length(head) {
  let i = 0;
  while (head) {
    head = head.next;
    i++;
  }
  return i;
}

function count(head, data) {
  let count = 0;
  while (head) {
    if (data === head.data) {
      count += 1;
    }
    head = head.next;
  }
  return count;
