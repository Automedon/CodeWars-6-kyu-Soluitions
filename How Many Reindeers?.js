Description:
Santa puts all the presents into the huge sack. In order to let his reindeers rest a bit, he only takes as many reindeers with him as he is required to do. The others may take a nap.

Two reindeers are always required for the sleigh and Santa himself. Additionally he needs 1 reindeer per 30 presents. As you know, Santa has 8 reindeers in total, so he can deliver up to 180 presents at once (2 reindeers for Santa and the sleigh + 6 reindeers with 30 presents each).

Complete the function reindeers(), which takes a number of presents and returns the minimum numbers of required reindeers. If the number of presents is too high, throw an error.

Examles:

reindeers(0); // must return 2
reindeers(1); // must return 3
reindeers(30); // must return 3
reindeers(200); // must throw an error
*/
function reindeers(presents) {
  if (presents===0) return 2
  if (presents<=30) return 3
  if (presents<=60) return 4
  if (presents<=90) return 5
  if (presents<=120) return 6
  if (presents<=150) return 7
  if (presents<=180) return 8
  throw Error()
}
