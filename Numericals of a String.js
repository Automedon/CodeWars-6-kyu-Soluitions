/*
Description:
You are given an input string.

For each symbol in the string if it's the first character occurence, replace it with a '1', else replace it with the amount of times you've already seen it...

But will your code be performant enough?

Examples:
input   =  "Hello, World!"
result  =  "1112111121311"

input   =  "aaaaaaaaaaaa"
result  =  "123456789101112"
*/
function numericals(s){
  const obj={}
  return s.replace(/./g,v=>obj[v]=(obj[v]||0)+1)
}
