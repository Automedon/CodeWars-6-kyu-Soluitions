/*
Description:
An anagram is a word, a phrase, or a sentence formed from another by rearranging its letters. An example of this is "angel", which is an anagram of "glean".

Write a function that receives an array of words, and returns the total number of distinct pairs of anagramic words inside it.

Some examples:

There are 2 anagrams in the array ["dell", "ledl", "abc", "cba"]
There are 7 anagrams in the array ["dell", "ledl", "abc", "cba", "bca", "bac"]
*/
function anagramCounter (wordsArray) {
  let count=0;
  for (let i=0;i<wordsArray.length-1;i++){
    for (let j=i+1;j<wordsArray.length;j++){
      if (wordsArray[i].split``.sort().join``===wordsArray[j].split``.sort().join``) {count++}
    }
  }
  return count;
}
